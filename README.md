# The I dream of Jeannie Project by Rucha Nimbalkar

Front End and Back End (Database & API endpoint)

## About

This is a hobby-project of mine to have a website that is a tribute to the legendary sitcom "I dream of Jeannie".
I have fond memories of this show and I always wondered why there was no API for this amazing show.

Currently, I only have a home page and characters page, I hope to add more to this project soon.
